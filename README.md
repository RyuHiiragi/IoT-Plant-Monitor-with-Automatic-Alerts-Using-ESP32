# IoT Plant Monitor with Automatic Alerts Using ESP32

This repository contains the Arduino code, configuration, and assembly instructions for building an IoT-based plant monitoring system using the ESP32 microcontroller. The system monitors environmental conditions such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light intensity, and sends automatic alerts if the conditions require attention <button class="citation-flag" data-index="8">. This project is ideal for smart gardening, agriculture, or home automation applications.

## Overview
The IoT plant monitor uses the ESP32 to collect data from various sensors, including soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light intensity. If any parameter exceeds predefined thresholds, the system triggers an alert using a buzzer and LED indicators. Additionally, the data is sent to an online platform like Blynk for remote monitoring <button class="citation-flag" data-index="6">. This project helps users maintain optimal growing conditions for their plants.

## Assembly Instructions
Follow these detailed steps to assemble your IoT plant monitor:

1. Connect the soil moisture sensor to the ESP32 for measuring soil moisture levels.
2. Connect the DHT22 sensor to monitor temperature and humidity <button class="citation-flag" data-index="8">.
3. Connect the BH1750 light sensor to measure ambient light intensity <button class="citation-flag" data-index="9">.
4. Connect the buzzer and LEDs to provide audible and visual alerts.
5. Power the system using a USB cable.
6. Secure all components inside a protective enclosure.
